# Konsole
Konsole is a game framework built for the CMD.
It's written in C# and is running on .NET Core which should ensure cross-platform support.

Please note that this is an amatour project made as something to exercise and entertain myself with.
If you do however end up using it please show me your creation, thanks!

Elements of the framework are inspired by the [osu.Framework!](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework)
